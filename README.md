## Production build
`yarn build`

**Note:** You can find production build at _./build_.

## Run production build
`http-server ./build`

**Note:** SPA will not work correctly as the server has to be configured.

## Run development build
`yarn develop`

**Note:** SPA is working correctly here as _webpack-devserver_ is configured correctly.

## Run tests
`yarn test`

**Note:** There are some _console.error_ output which I did not handle.
